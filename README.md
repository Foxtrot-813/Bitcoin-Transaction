# Bitcoin Transaction Information Script
This is a Python script that retrieves information about a Bitcoin transaction and displays it in a human-readable format. The script uses the Blockchair API to retrieve the transaction data and wallet information.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run the script, you need Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Installing
 - Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required packages using the following command:

```py pip install requests ```
- Open the script file in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.

## Usage
To use the script, you need to provide two arguments: the transaction hash and your Blockchair API key. You can get your API key by signing up for a free account on Blockchair.

After running the script, it will display the following information:

- The main transaction details, including the amount transacted, transaction fee, and date.
- The involved senders and their wallet information, including their wallet balance, total received, total spent, and transaction count.
